# SocialShop

Efficiently complete your shopping list with the help of a friend(s).

## Background

I've got to go to Ikea soon. For those who haven't been to Ikea before, lets just say its an experience... Its:
 
 - huge
 - busy
 - very distracting

You (or at least I) could easily spend the whole day there. Not on purposee. There are just so many items to buy that you end up thinking "yeah, I COULD use a xyz" and this is where the problem lies.

Although not purposefully, Ikea have started to address these problems. Their app lets you create a shopping list beforehand, so, in theory, you can park up, enter the shop and go to ailse x, y, z, pay and leave in a fairly predictable amount of time.

However, that doesn't quite solve the problem of people traffic. And people traffic is bad. Very bad.

This is what this app would try to solve.

My trips to Ikea are usually in a group. Groups are good. Groups allow you to achieve a goal faster by splitting the work. For example, cooking. When you cook in a group, you may have someone preparing vegetables, another preparing meat, another weighing out the correct measurements of other ingredients and another setting the table.

So why can't we do this with shopping? Imagine you've got a shopping list of 20 items. Rather than swarming around the shop in a group, you'd split up and, as you collect an item, you check it off the list and the other sub-groups get a notification.

Obviously the Ikea scenario is pertinent as I'm planning that trip soon. However, imagine you're in a supermarket and its the week before Christmas and you've got loads of guests coming around and you want to get some food for everyone. Or say you're a parent doing a back to school shop. Or there is a sale on at a popular store.


## Implementation

I've not thought too much about how this could be done, however it would need to work without a data connection. I'm not sure why but most of the shopping malls I go to have really poor data connectivity, possibly due to the number of people? With that in mind, I'd imagine WebRTC would come into it somewhere...


## Next steps

Create a prototype.
